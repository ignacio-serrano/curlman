Project layout
--------------
Ignore this section for now.
  * `src`: Here it is where source code is.
    * `main`: Here it is where source code meant to be part of the application
              lives.
    * `test`: Here it is where the test scripts and other test related files 
              live (so they are not copied when it is installed).

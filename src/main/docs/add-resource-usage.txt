Usage: curlman.sh add resource [--help | <resource path>]
  --help          : Displays this help.
  <resource path> : A resource path. If starting with "/", it will be treated
                    as relative to the service base URL. If not, it will be
                    treated as relative to the the current directory (which still
                    can be a service directory root).

Usage: curlman.sh add service [--help | <service name> <base url> [<curlman root directory>]]
  --help                   : Displays this help.
  <service name>           : A name to identify the service created. It has to 
                             be a valid directory name.
  <base url>               : The base URL of the service. Think about it as the 
                             prefix to be added to the path of all endpoints in
                             this service.
  <curlman root directory> : The curlman root directory to add the service to.
                             If omitted, it defaults to the current directory.
                             If a subdirectory of a curlman root directory is
                             specified, curlman will infer the curlman root
                             directory and use that instead.

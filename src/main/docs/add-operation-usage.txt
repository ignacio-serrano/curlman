Usage: curlman.sh add operation [--help | <method> [<resource path>]]
  --help          : Displays this help.
  <method>        : An HTTP method.
  <resource path> : A resource path. If starting with "/", it will be treated
                    as relative to the service base URL. If not, it will be
                    treated as relative to the the current directory (which still
                    can be a service directory root).
